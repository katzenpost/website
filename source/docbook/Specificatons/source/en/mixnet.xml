                        refer to the clients as nodes. </para>

        <para> The presented system design is based on <link linkend="LOOPIX">LOOPIX</link> Below,
            we present the system overview. </para>
        <para> The entry mixes are responsible for authenticating clients, accepting packets from
            the client, and forwarding them to the mix network, which then relays packets to the
            destination service mix. Our network design uses a strict topology where forward message
            traverse the network from entry mix to service mix. Service mixes can optionally reply
            if the forward message contained a Single Use Reply Block (see <link
                linkend="SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</link>. </para>
        <para> The PKI system that handles the distribution of various network wide parameters, and
            information required for each participant to participate in the network such as IP
            address/port combinations that each node can be reached at, and cryptographic public
            keys. The specification for the PKI is beyond the scope of this document and is instead
            covered in <link linkend="KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</link>. </para>
        <para> The mix network provides neither reliable nor in-order delivery semantics. The
            described mix network is neither a user facing messaging system nor is it an
            application. It is intended to be a low level protocol which can be composed to form
            more elaborate mixnet protocols with stronger more useful privacy notions. </para>
        <section xml:id="threat-model">
            <title xml:id="threat-model.title">2.1 Threat Model</title>
            <para> Here we cannot present the threat model to the higher level mixnet protocols.
                However this low level core mixnet protocol does have it’s own threat model which we
                attempt to illucidate here. </para>
            <para> We assume that the clients only talk to mixnet services. These services make use
                of a client provided delivery token known as a SURB (Single Use Reply Block) to send
                their replies to the client without knowing the client’s entry mix. This system
                guarantees third-party anonymity, meaning that no parties other than client and the
                service are able to learn that the client and service are communicating. Note that
                this is in contrast with other designs, such as Mixminion, which provide sender
                anonymity towards recipients as well as anonymous replies. </para>
            <para> Mixnet clients will randomly select an entry node to use and may reconnect if
                disconnected for under a duration threshold. The entry mix can determine the
                approximate message volume originating from and destined to a given client. We
                consider the entry mix follows the protocol and might be an honest-but-curious
                adversary. </para>
            <para> External local network observers can not determine the number of Packets
                traversing their region of the network because of the use of decoy traffic sent by
                the clients. Global observers will not be able to de-anonymize packet paths if there
                are enough packets traversing the mix network. Longer term statistical disclosure
                attacks are likely possible in order to link senders and receivers. </para>
            <para> A malicious mix only has the ability to remember which input packets correspond
                to the output packets. To discover the entire path all of the mixes in the path
                would have to be malicious. Moreover, the malicious mixes can drop, inject, modify
                or delay the packets for more or less time than specified. </para>

            <title xml:id="network-topology.title">2.2 Network Topology</title>
            <para> The Katzenpost Mix Network uses a layered topology consisting of a fixed number
                of layers, each containing a set of mixes. At any given time each Mix MUST only be
                assigned to one specific layer. Each Mix in a given layer N is connected to every

            <para> As a mixing technique the Poisson mix strategy <link linkend="LOOPIX"
                    >LOOPIX</link> and <link linkend="KESDOGAN98">KESDOGAN98</link> is used, which
                REQUIRES that a packet at each hop in the route is delayed by some amount of time,
                randomly selected by the sender from an exponential distribution. This strategy
                allows to prevent the timing correlation of the incoming and outgoing traffic from
                each node. Additionally, the parameters of the distribution used for generating the
                delay can be tuned up and down depending on the amount of traffic in the network and
                the application for which the system is deployed. </para>
