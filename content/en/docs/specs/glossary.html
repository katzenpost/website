                  <p>Clients are NOT considered nodes in the mix network. However note that
                     network protocols are often layered; in our design documents we describe
                     "mixnet hidden services" which can be operated by mixnet clients. Therefore
                     if you are using node in some adherence to methematical termonology one
                     could conceivably designate a client as a node. That having been said, it
                     would not be appropriate to the discussion of our core mixnet protocol to
                     refer to the clients as nodes.</p>

                     Packets are routed anonymously through the mixnet and cryptographically transformed

                  <p>A service operated by a third party that Clients communicate directly with
                     to communicate with the Mixnet. It is responsible for Client authentication,
                     forwarding outgoing messages to the Mixnet, and storing incoming messages
                     for the Client. The Provider MUST have the ability to perform cryptographic

                     composed of multiple stages connected by queues utilizing active queue
                     management algorithms that can evict items from the queue based on dwell
                     time or other criteria where each stage is a thread pool. 3. The only
