Katzenpost is a free and open-source software project advancing
anonymous communication through innovative mixnet protocols. As the
world's first post-quantum mixnet, Katzenpost integrates cutting-edge
cryptography to ensure future-proof privacy. Our rigorous security
design includes the first-ever comprehensive threat model for a
mixnet, setting a new standard for secure, resilient online
communication.
