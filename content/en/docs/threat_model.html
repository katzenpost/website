<h1>Threat Model</h1>

<h1 id="the-purpose-and-structure-of-this-document">The purpose and
structure of this document</h1>
<p>This threat model document is unique in the privacy technology
landscape for its detailed treatment of realistic adversary
capabilities. It is not a description of a superficial, theoretical
system, but rather of complex, real-life software that is being
interrogated and constantly re-designed to provide the best possible
security. We examine it from the point of view of both theoretical
design, networking choices and practical pitfalls.</p>
<p>And still, it is not and will likely never be comprehensive. Various
attacks and countermeasure strategies will be added to this document in
the future, as it keeps evolving. However, we feel that it already
provides a valuable, systematic view of the challenges faced by mixnet
technology.</p>
<p>There exists a rich body of academic work analyzing how one might
disrupt the functioning of a Mixnet or circumvent its security and
privacy guarantees. We have endeavored to compile these decades research
and summarized these attacks in the table on page 3. The table on page 4
focuses on networking security threats that are specific to Katzenpost
protocol choices.</p>
<p>We then delve into the countermeasures employed by Katzenpost and
discuss their efficacy. A special care is taken to discuss the details
of post-quantum cryptographic primitives that we have introduced in
several places of the design.</p>
<h1 id="introducing-the-adversary">Introducing the adversary</h1>
<p>It is no longer controversial to say that in the modern world, we
face incredibly powerful surveillance adversaries. These could be state,
corporate or criminal actors, vying for our information to use as means
of making profit, manipulating us and others, gaining leverage,
strengthening their authority, or as means of persecution. In many
contexts, we have little hope for non-technical solutions due to lack of
sufficiently powerful pressure in favor of privacy.</p>
<p>And so in a quest for technical solutions, we need equally powerful
tools. In the case of communication tools, the Internet’s bread and
butter, we would like to allow users to interact and exchange
information with reasonable expectation of both the content and metadata
of their communication, and personal information such as a user’s social
graph, being protected from such adversaries. Therefore, we consider an
adversary capable of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The adversary can see the connections of the entire global
internet and is capable of intricate statistical analysis of gathered
data.</p></li>
<li><p>The adversary can disable parts of the network.</p></li>
<li><p>The adversary can plant or take over some devices in the network
to inject malicious code and manipulate the functioning of the network
or to gain access to the information available to them. The takeover
could happen by technical means or by exercising force outside of the
network.</p></li>
<li><p>The adversary has very large (but not infinite) computational
resources, and is capable of cryptanalysis on par with frontier
research.</p></li>
<li><p>The adversary has access to a quantum computer, or will have
access to a quantum computer in the near future.</p></li>
<li><p>The adversary can supplement collected data with rich context of
already gathered data on all users from other sources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we hope for our work to be relevant in the modern world, we can no
longer settle for weak threat models. That is the bar we set for
ourselves at Katzenpost.</p>
<h1 id="katzenpost-mixnet-threat-model-summary">Katzenpost mixnet threat
model summary</h1>
<p>Firstly, assumptions about the user:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The user acts reasonably and in good faith.</p></li>
<li><p>The user obtains an authentic copy of the Katzenpost client and
the mixnet client configuration file.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Secondly, assumptions about the user’s computer:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The computer operates correctly and is not compromised by
malware.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thirdly, assumptions about the mixnet:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The mixnet only provides internal services and does not have any
"exit nodes" or anything that resembles a proxy service or VPN.</p></li>
<li><p>All mixnet protocols are protocols which do not force
interaction.</p></li>
<li><p>All mixnet protocols are low bandwidth and latency
tolerant.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, assumptions about the world:<br />
The three core protocols of Katzenpost are configured to use modern
cryptographic primitives which are valid and considered impossible to
break, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PKI Signature Scheme using Edd25519-Sphincs+</p></li>
<li><p>NIKE Sphinx using X25519</p></li>
<li><p>PQ Noise with pqXX pattern using Xwing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What the user’s Gateway can achieve keeping in mind that typically a
fair sized mixnet will have more than one gateway node:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Gateway node learns when a given client is online.</p></li>
<li><p>A Gateway node learns the client’s IP address.</p></li>
<li><p>A Gateway node learns how many messages the client sends and
receives.</p></li>
<li><p>A Gateway node does NOT learn the sent message destinations or
the received message origins.</p></li>
<li><p>A Gateway node does NOT learn if a given sent or received message
is a decoy or not.</p></li>
<li><p>A Gateway node can drop or correupt any sent or received
message.</p></li>
<li><p>A Gateway node can spam a user with invalid messages.</p></li>
<li><p>A Gateway node can duplicate old messages. However duplicate
outbound messages will be dropped by the first hop as per Sphinx packet
deduplication cache.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What a sufficiently global, passive adversary can achieve:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A GPA can learn who is using the mixnet and where their Gateway
nodes are located.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What a local network attacker can achieve:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A local network can observe when a user is using
Katzenpost.</p></li>
<li><p>A local network can block Katzenpost.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What a compromise of the user’s computer can achieve:<br />
After an endpoint device is compromised, an attacker can impersonate
that user, receiving and sending messages. The attacker does NOT learn
the communication correspondent network locations.</p>
<p>What a Service Node can achieve:<br />
A Service Node on the mix network does not know from whence it’s service
request message came. Therefore in general, absent some clever attack,
the Service Nodes learn nothing about the clients that interact with
them.</p>
<p>What a contact can achieve:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A contact can spam a user with messages.</p></li>
<li><p>A contact can, to some extent, prove to a third-party that a
message came from a user</p></li>
<li><p>A contact can retain messages from a user, forever.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What a random person on the Internet can achieve:<br />
A random person can attempt to DoS the mix network or a specific service
on the mixnet.</p>

<h1 id="attack-countermeasures">Attack Countermeasures</h1>
<p>Here we describe the attack countermeasures currently used by the
Katzenpost mix network software design.</p>
<h2 id="intersection-attacks">Intersection Attacks</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description">Attack description:</h4>
<p>Intersection attacks, also known as long term statistical disclosure
attacks have two basic categories:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Adversary learns to whom Alice sends messages.</p></li>
<li><p>The Adversary learns who sends Alice messages.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="section"></h4>
<p>Statistical disclosure attacks work to some extent on all anonymous
communication networks. The Katzenpost client and Katzen messaging
protocol is designed to provide partial defense against long-term
intersection attacks as well as sufficient defence against short-term
timing correlation attacks.</p>
<p>The simplest form of this attack assumes a global passive adversary
who watches Alice’s interactions with the mix network. Whenever Alice
sends a message, a set of potential recipients are noted by observing
which clients receive a message shortly after Alice sends her message.
After many hours, days or weeks of noting these sets of potential
recipients, an intersection among these sets may reveal the set of
recipients Alice sends messages to.</p>
<p>The classical mix network literature has described intersection
attacks in terms of a mix network where a passive network observer can
watch individual clients receive messages. This assumption can be
otherwise stated that the adversary observes all the inputs and outputs
of the mix network and thus receives a high granularity of statistical
information.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure">countermeasure</h4>
<p>Katzenpost and the Katzen messaging protocol are designed to provide
partial defense against intersection attacks. Complete defense is not
practical because user behavior is often repetitive and they cannot stay
connected to the mixnet forever. Attack success depends largely on the
adversary’s ability to predict user behavior. If user’s behavior is
overly repetitive this may lead to the success of such attacks.</p>
<p>Although the Katzenpost continuous time mixing strategy provides
defense against short term timing correlation attacks, additional
defense mechanisms are required to defend against longer term
attacks:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>async message queueing and retrieval at the network edge</p></li>
<li><p>traffic padded message retrieval</p></li>
<li><p>loop decoy traffic</p></li>
<li><p>uniform traffic patterns (all sent messages result in a SURB
reply)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="section-1"></h4>
<p>The Katzenpost chat protocol known as Katzen, uses an additional
network route to provide another indirection to protect the network
location of clients. In other words, while Katzen clients connect to the
mixnet using a randomly selected entry Provider, they retrieve messages
from a different Provider mix node on the network; message retrieval is
done by means of a Sphinx SURB, single use reply block which is sent to
the messaging queue service so that a reply containing a message payload
can be sent back to the client, anonymously. All sent messages result in
a SURB reply being sent back to the client.</p>
<p>Katzenpost clients periodically send loop decoy messages; these
Sphinx packets are sent to a randomly selected Provider whose echo
service sends the client’s packet payload back to the client via the
attached SURB. However, loop decoy messages are only distinguishable
from normal messages to the client that receives them. Passive network
observers will not be able to tell the difference. These decoy loops are
uniformly distributed among all of the Providers (AKA service/exit mix
nodes).</p>
<p>Whenever clients retrieve messages from their locally connected entry
Provider, they do so using a traffic padded protocol that either sends
them 0 or 1 message where both outcomes are indistinguishable from the
perspective of a passive network observer.</p>
<h2 id="n-1-attacks"><span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>
Attacks</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-1">attack description:</h4>
<p>An <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attack is a multi
stage attack where the adversary observes a target message enter the
mixnet and must perform the attack in order to follow the message to the
next hop. The <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attack is
performed repeatedly for each hop in the route in order to discover the
final destination.</p>
<p>Although the adversary could simply compromise each mix node in the
route starting with the first hop, that is the compulsion attack
category and is a distinct attack category from the <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attack category. The <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attack is performed by the
adversary compromising upstream routers so that they have the capability
of watching messages enter the target mix, blocking any of those
messages if they choose to, and sending messages of their own into the
target mix node. By using these capabilities the adversary is able to
manipulate mix nodes so that they only contain the target message and
messages sent by the adversary.</p>
<p>For a good introduction to <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attacks, please see . In the
context of continuous time mixing strategies like "Stop and Go" and
Poisson , the <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attack is
performed by the adversary blocking or delaying (although delaying
obviously wouldn’t work for Stop and Go) incoming messages ahead of time
so that they are reasonably certain the mix is empty before the target
message enters the mix.</p>
<p>When the target message enters the empty mix, it is artificially
delayed by the mixing strategy and then routed to the next hop. The
adversary gets to observe where the message is going for it’s next hop
because they are reasonably sure that the message exiting the mix,
although it is bitwise unlinkable because of the cryptographic
transformation, it must be the same message.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-1">countermeasure</h4>
<p>: Katzenpost currently does not have any countermeasures in place for
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attacks. See Future
Countermeasures section below.</p>
<h2 id="epistemic-attack-route-fingerprinting">Epistemic Attack: route
fingerprinting</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-2">attack description:</h4>
<p>A route fingerprinting attack is when the adversary is able to
identify a client by the specific route being used.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-2">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>Katzenpost doesn’t allow clients to have a partial view of the
network. The directory authority system publishes the full network view
to be cached by the edge nodes, Providers, so that clients can retrieve
them.</p>
<h2 id="denial-of-service">Denial of Service</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-3">attack description:</h4>
<p>Sending many packets into the mix network can cause the mix nodes to
become overwhelmed and begin dropping packets. The logical conclusion to
this scenario is that there is effectively a network outage until the
adversary stops sending so much traffic.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-3">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>Rate limiting individual clients is the current countermeasure.
However this only stops the DOS attack from being conducted by a single
client entity. However the adversary could still DOS the network by
using many clients to send packets.</p>
<h2 id="sybil-attack">Sybil Attack</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-4">attack description:</h4>
<p>The adversary plants a large number of malicious nodes, and is
therefore able to glean partial or complete information to follow a
message through the mix network.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-4">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>We mitigate Sybil attacks by preventing mix nodes from automatically
joining the network. A prerequesite for joining the network is to have
all the directory authorities add the new mix node’s connection
information and public cryptographic key material to their
configuration. Please see the Future Countermeasures section below for a
discussion of additional directory authority features including a
reputation system.</p>
<h2 id="compulsion-attack">Compulsion Attack</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-5">attack description:</h4>
<p>The adversary compels enough honest node operators to disclose
information to follow a message through the mix network.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-5">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>Our current countermeasure for the compulsion attack is frequent mix
key rotation, every 20 minutes. See Future Countermeasures section
below.</p>
<h2 id="timing-attacks">Timing Attacks</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-6">attack description:</h4>
<p>An active adversary manipulates the timing of the packets passing
through compromised routers, or passive adversary exploits timing
information that is leaked despite padding.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no known timing attacks against any Katzenpost
protocols. Timing correlation attacks are already covered in the
intersection attack category. And although all mix network protocols
leak statistical information no matter what countermeasures are used, we
posit that this leaked statistical information isn’t really the same
thing as traditional timing attacks against a cryptographic system. In
fact, the mix network is actively preventing timing attacks injecting
latency into the system.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-6">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>No known timing attacks and therefore no countermeasure.</p>
<h2 id="cryptographic-attacks">Cryptographic Attacks</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-7">attack description:</h4>
<p>There are no known cryptographic attacks against Katzenpost core
protocols (sphinx, noise, dirauth). However we explore theoretical
cryptographic attacks in the Cryptographic Protocols section below.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-7">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>All core Katzenpost protocols make use of hybrid post quantum
cryptographic constructions which in theory protect against active
quantum adversaries.</p>
<h2 id="endpoint-security-attacks">Endpoint Security Attacks</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-8">attack description:</h4>
<p>The adversary breaches the security of a user’s device via an attack
not directly related to the mixnet.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-8">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>There are no countermeasures provided by Katzenpost for endpoint
security because it’s considered an orthogonal concern.</p>
<h2 id="tagging-attack">Tagging Attack</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-9">attack description:</h4>
<p>The Sphinx cryptographic packet format allows for a one bit tagging
attack under certain circumstances. The reason for allowing the design
to have this security defect is to allow for the Single Use Reply Block.
The Sphinx header is MAC’ed but the packet body is not. Instead, the
body is encrypted with a wide-block cipher (an SPRP). This ensures that
an expected verification block in the beginning of the plaintext can be
used to verify the plaintext in the final decryption. If a bit in the
payload ciphertext gets flipped then the payload decryption will yield
garbled results and the expected verification block will not be present.
Therefore in order to make use of this to perform a tagging attack, the
adversary must have access to the result of the payload decryption as
well as the ability to tag the packet some number of hops earlier in the
route. We call this a one bit tagging attack because it yield one bit of
information: Either the verification block was destroyed or not.</p>
<p>In Katzenpost there are two ways to use Sphinx to send a payload.
Forwards packets and SURB reply packets. Both of these Sphinx packet
types are susceptible to a one bit tagging attack:</p>
<h4 id="tagging-attack-against-forward-sphinx-packets">tagging attack
against forward Sphinx packets:</h4>
<p>Clients send forwards Sphinx packets to mixnet services which reply
via a SURB in the payload. Let’s say an adversary "tags" a forward
Sphinx packet sent by Alice. The adversary would have to compromise or
collude with the service Providers on the mixnet in order to witness the
forward packet payload decryption failure which indicates the tag.</p>
<h4 id="tagging-attack-against-surb-replay-sphinx-packets">tagging
attack against SURB replay Sphinx packets:</h4>
<p>If an adversary "tags" a SURB reply which a mixnet service sends to a
client, then only the client will be able to witness the packet payload
decryption failure. The adversary would have to compromise the client’s
endpoint device to witness this event (or to compromise the key
materials allowing them to compute the failed payload decryption
themselves).</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-9">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>In the context of a forward Sphinx tagging attack on Katzenpost, the
adversary must compromise or collude with the destination service
Provider. If that’s the case then attack allows the adversary to learn
which Provider node and service the packets was destined for. Although
this is valuable information in the context of the current Katzen
protocol, see the Future Countermeasures section below for a discussion
of how we plan to mitigate intersection attacks in the future because it
also carries over to much greater defense against this forward payload
tagging attack.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-10">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>We could encode the last hop’s Sphinx routing command, inside the
Sphinx payload instead of the header. This would provide short term
plausible deniability in the sense that an adversary conducting a
tagging attack would be destroying the routing information so that they
cannot know if the packet was a decoy or not.</p>
<h2 id="replay-confirmation-attack">Replay Confirmation Attack</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-10">attack description:</h4>
<p>If a Sphinx packet were allowed to be replayed then the adversary may
send the packet many times concurrently in order to observe the traffic
burst in another section of the network.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-11">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>Katzenpost mix nodes maintain a relay cache which prevents Sphinx
packets from being replayed. This cache doesn’t grow forever since it’s
only kept until the end of the epoch which are currently only a 20
minute duration.</p>
<h2 id="surb-confirmation-attack">SURB Confirmation Attack</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-11">attack description:</h4>
<p>If a client sends many SURBs to another entity on the network, that
entity may choose to send out ALL the SURBs at once in order to observe
the traffic burst in another part of the network. This works as an entry
node discovery attack.</p>
<p>Although currently, all Katzenpost protocols only send one SURB at a
time, this attack still applies if the adversary accumulates enough
SURBs to form a visible traffic burst within the mix network.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-12">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>No countermeasure. See Future Attack Countermeasure section below for
the discussion of how to countermeasure this attack.</p>

<p>Currently, no countermeasure.</p>
<h2 id="predecessor-attack">Predecessor Attack</h2>
<h4 id="attack-description-13">attack description:</h4>
<p>A bad route is defined as a route in which every node is compromised.
The goal of such an attack is to link a given client with a specific
destination or service on the destination node. This attack is also
known as the Predecessor Attack and is detailed in with many variations
for all the different types of anonymous communication networks. In the
context of the Katzenpost mixnet, the Predecessor Attack is performed by
the adversary compromising at least one node in each routing topology
layer. Clients using the mixnet will eventually select a bad route.</p>
<h4 id="countermeasure-14">countermeasure:</h4>
<p>Fundamentally, we have two choices, either we have clients select a
new route for each message sent or they select one route and use that
for some time duration. In the former, every time a message is sent, the
probability of selecting a bad route is increased. Whilst in the later,
if a client selects a bad route they use it many times, but the
probability of selecting a bad route is reduced.</p>
<h4 id="section-2"></h4>
<p>Yet another countermeasure is to design the mixnet protocols such
that they use a new destination for each message using some kind of
private deterministic permutation achieving a uniform distribution of
message amongst the destination mixnet nodes and their message slots. We
have chosen this last countermeasure for Katzenpost and it will be
detailed elsewhere in our literature.</p>
<h1 id="future-countermeasures">Future Countermeasures</h1>
<h2 id="intersection-attacks-1">Intersection Attacks</h2>
<h4 id="section-3"></h4>
<p>The new Katzen protocol is sometimes referred to as scatter queue.
Two communicating parties each exchange shared secrets which they use to
determine a new "mailbox" for each message. To be clear, this new
protocol is an improved revision of the previous Katzen protocol where
each party chooses their own "mailbox" (queue Provider + queue ID); the
difference here is that instead of the two parties exchanging mailbox
locations they exchange seeds which are used to determinically generate
mailbox locations for each message.</p>
<p>This new protocol still uses all four previously mentioned mechanisms
to achieve countermeasure against intersection attacks however the new
"scatter queue" design drastically reduces the amount of metadata which
can be collected by the operators of the mailbox Provider mix nodes. We
think this is a huge improvement to the threat model. But it would be
great if we could quantify the improvement using various anonymity
metrics. Firstly, Shannon entropy seems applicable here because we can
make statements like "compared to the old protocol, scatter queue
increases the entropy on Providers where malicious adversaries are
trying to correlate communicating party sets with messages arriving at
specific mailboxes"; the new protocol makes this infeasible.</p>
<p>Therefore we can say that the new Katzen messaging protocol mitigates
or partially mitigates intersection attacks by means of five
mechanisms:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>async message queueing and retrieval at the network edge</p></li>
<li><p>traffic padded message retrieval</p></li>
<li><p>loop decoy traffic</p></li>
<li><p>uniform traffic patterns (all sent messages result in a SURB
reply)</p></li>
<li><p>scatter queue</p></li>
</ol>

Attacks</h2>
<h4 id="section-4"></h4>
<p>Here we will attempt to describe a partial countermeasure wherein
clients receive statistical information from the network which is
cryptographically signed by it’s authors. Client use this data to decide
if there’s an ongoing <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>
attack, if there is they disconnect from the network and try again
later.</p>
<p>There are two sources of information about <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>mix loops</p></li>
<li><p>client loops</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="mix-loops-vs-client-loops">Mix loops vs client loops</h4>
<p>In theory mix loops can detect <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attacks in the context of a
continuous time mix. Such an attack means the adversary is dropping or
delaying messages before they enter the mix. Therefore the mix
originating loop decoy message can function as a sort of heartbeat
protocol that allow the mix to detect <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attacks. Obviously this mix
loop decoy message might get dropped by the network for various reasons
that have nothing to do with an <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attack. The red green blue
heartbeat mixnet paper (by george) suggests the countermeasure of the
individual mixes halting their routing of messages temporarily to thwart
the <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attacks. This would
work but it would also probably create unnecessary outages. Instead we
want a system that let’s the client software decide whether or not there
is an ongoing <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> attack.
Clients can also detect such attacks with their own end to end loop
decoy messages. However we want the mixes to publish a signed
certificate containing their mix loop statistics. Client will then
download these mix loop statistics from the providers and they will use
those statistics along with their own client loop statistics to make
decisions with regards to <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> network status.</p>
<p><strong>TODO: add detailed description of client heuristics for
deciding if there’s an n-1 attack</strong></p>
<h1 id="core-cryptographic-protocols">Core Cryptographic Protocols</h1>
<p>Katzenpost consists of three cryptographic protocols:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>PKI/Dirauth</p></li>
<li><p>PQ Noise</p></li>
<li><p>Sphinx</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Katzenpost is an overlay network meaning that we aren’t trying to
replace IP (internet protocol). Overlay means we build protocol layers
that sit on top of existing Internet protocols. Currently Katzenpost
works over TCP/IP however in the future we plan to support QUIC/IP as an
optional transport that can be selected.</p>
<p>Katzenpost uses a PQ Noise based protocol known as the Katzenpost
wire protocol, which provides point to point transport security and
authorization. The wire protocol enforces the mix network’s topology
whereby the clients are only allowed to connect to gateway nodes,
gateway nodes are only allowed to send packets to layer 1 mixes, and
layer 1 mixes are only allowed to send packets to layer 2 mixes etc.</p>
<p>Clients use the wire protocol to talk to gateway nodes to whom they
send Sphinx packets. These Sphinx packets are encapsulated within the
encrypted PQ Noise messages and are therefore never exposed to passive
network observers but if they were there wouldn’t in principle be any
problem with that. This redundancy in security is often referred to as
"defense in depth".</p>
<p>Besides within the mixnet itself, the wire protocol is also used to
directly communicate with the directory authorities. Gateway nodes
retrieve the latest PKI document from the directory authorities and
cache the document for the epoch duration so that clients can download
the cached copy. This is a notably different use case because within the
mixnet we should have the goal of padding all the wire protocol commands
to be the same size. Whereas when gateways nodes download the consensus
they are likely receiving PKI documents which are perhaps many times
bigger than our Sphinx packet size.</p>
<p>The PKI/Directory authority protocol stands apart from the rest
because it’s the root of all authority within the mix network. The PKI
provides the network participants with all the connection information
and key materials they need to use the other two protocols, PQ Noise and
Sphinx. It does so by publishing a PKI document every epoch (currently
20 minutes). This is necessary because the mixes destroy their old mix
keys and create new mix keys for each new epoch thereby reducing the
window for compulsion attacks to the epoch duration.</p>
<p>Both the PQ Noise based wire protocol AND our Sphinx protocols are
considered to be transport protocols. However the dirauth as the 3rd
cryptographic protocol here refers to two aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The client and mixnet interactions with the dirauth system; That
is, the pki document itself it signed by a majority of the dirauth nodes
AND the pki document contains the mix descriptor for each mix node in
the network. The document also specifies the topology. Mix nodes and
clients verify these cryptographic signatures.</p></li>
<li><p>The dirauth’s crash fault consensus cryptographic protocol for
publishing new PKI documents every epoch.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="katzenpost-pki-directory-authority">Katzenpost PKI / Directory
Authority</h1>
<figure>

<figcaption>The dirauth system has voting protocol rounds where each
party exchanges votes with every other party.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="section-5"></h4>
<p>The public key infrastructure (PKI) protocol for Katzenpost, also
known as the Directory Authority or dirauth, is a decentralized system
of nodes which vote for each epoch’s consensus document. If we used a
BFT protocol instead then the dirauth system would fail when 1/3 + 1
nodes failed. Therefore we can say that our crash fault tolerant system
is more robust because it will fail when 1/2 + 1 nodes fail.</p>
<p>The Katzenpost PKI is the security root of the entire system because
all clients and network nodes will depend on the PKI to sign the
consensus document for each epoch. Currently epoch duration is every 20
minutes. The consensus document is essentially a view of the network, it
contains all the connection information and all the public cryptographic
key materials and signatures. Each mix node signs it’s descriptor and
uploads it to the dirauth nodes. Each dirauth node signs the consensus.
When clients or nodes download the consensus document they are able to
verify the dirauth node signatures on the document.</p>
<p>Currently we use a hybrid signature scheme consisting of the
classical Ed25519 and the post quantum stateless hash based signature
scheme known as Sphincs+ with the parameters: ‘sphincs-shake-256f‘</p>
<h1 id="the-katzenpost-noise-protocol-layer">The Katzenpost Noise
Protocol Layer</h1>
<p>Early versions of Katzenpost used the Noise cryptographic protocol
framework; however we used an HFS (hybrid forward secret) variation of
XX handshake that used a post quantum KEM however it could not resist
active quantum adversaries since the initial keys exchanged were
classical ECDH public keys. Such constructions offer protections against
current classical adversaries that record ciphertext transcripts in
hopes of breaking them in the future with a cryptographically relevant
quantum computer.</p>
<p>More recently, Katzenpost was made to use PQ Noise from the paper,
entitled, Post Quantum Noise . The paper shows us that we can
algebraically transform existing classical Noise handshake patterns into
post quantum handshake patterns by replacing all usages of ECDH with
KEM. In some of these transformations there’s additional network
interactions implied.</p>
<p>Our current, hybrid KEM uses our security preserving KEM combiner and
the NIKE to KEM adapter (ad hoc hashed el gamal construction). Our Noise
protocol string is:</p>
<p>Noise_pqXX_Kyber768X25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b</p>
<p>Which means that our PQ Noise protocol uses the following
cryptographic primitives:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Hybrid KEM: KEM Combiner + NIKE to KEM adapter + X25519 +
Kyber768</p></li>
<li><p>MAC: Blake2b</p></li>
<li><p>AEAD: ChaChaPoly</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We use the PQ Noise handshake pattern known as pqXX<br />
which is expressed in the PQ Noise pattern language like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-&gt; e<br />
&lt;- ekem, s<br />
-&gt; skem, s<br />
&lt;- skem<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expressed as a sequence diagram, pqXX looks like this:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>pqXX sequence</figcaption>

<li><p>Server sends it’s static public key (s), encrypted with the KEM

<li><p>Client sends their static public key (s) encapsulated via KEM
ciphertext (skem) keyed to server’s static public key.</p></li>
<li><p>Server sends a KEM ciphertext (skem) encapsulated using the
client’s static public key.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="future-improvement-option-1">future improvement, option 1:</h4>
<p>Remove the "retrieve message" command which client’s use to poll for
new messages. Instead the client - server Noise protocol should be
designed such that clients periodically receive messages from the server
without requesting or polling for them. If no message is present in the
message queue on the server then the server will send the client a decoy
message.</p>
<h4 id="future-improvement-option-2">future improvement, option 2:</h4>
<p>Replace the "retrieve message" command with a "send and retrieve"
command whereby everytime the client sends a message they also receive a
message. As per usual, perhaps some of the messages send and received
are decoy messages.</p>
<h1 id="classical-sphinx-and-post-quantum-sphinx">Classical Sphinx and
Post Quantum Sphinx</h1>
<p>The original Sphinx paper introduces the Sphinx nested encrypted
packet format using a NIKE <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. NIKE Sphinx can be a
hybrid post quantum construction simply by using a hybrid NIKE. Our
Sphinx implementation also can optionally use a KEM <a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
instead of a NIKE, however the trade-off is that the packet’s header
will take up a lot of overhead because it must store a KEM ciphertext
for each hop. Katzenpost has a completely configurable Sphinx geometry
which allows for any KEM or NIKE to be used.</p>
<p>The Sphinx cryptographic packet format also uses these additional
cryptographic primitives, the current Katzenpost selection is:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>stream cipher: CTR-AES256</p></li>
<li><p>MAC: HMAC-SHA256</p></li>
<li><p>KDF: HKDF-SHA256</p></li>
<li><p>SPRP: AEZv5</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Katzenpost the dirauths select the Sphinx geometry, each dirauth
must agree with the other dirauths. They publish the hash of the Sphinx
Geometry in the PKI document so that the rest of the network entities
can validate their Sphinx Geometry. At the time of writing the namenlos
network still uses classical Sphinx with the following geometry:</p>

NrHops = 5<br />
HeaderLength = 476<br />

NIKEName = "x25519"<br />
KEMName = ""<br />
</p>
</figure>
<p>In the Katzenpost implementation of Sphinx, we MAC an unencrypted two
byte region at the beginning of the Sphinx packet; This additional data
region is to be used to match Sphinx version numbers.</p>
