Chat with us on our zulip chat server instance hosted by Zulip:
https://katzenpost.zulipchat.com/


* The cypherpunk ideal would be if we could all use a Katzenpost mixnet
to chat about ongoing katzenpost development, engineering and research
efforts. Let's save that for later when we've got our newer protocols
built out. For now, we can use Zulip which does not require a phone
number to sign up. We've heard Zulip works well with Tor.

* We used to have a mailing list. If people find that useful we can
bring back mailing lists.

* IRC (internet relay chat): we are not using IRC anymore to coordinate
